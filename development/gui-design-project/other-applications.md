Blender
-------

The standard ui components in Blender are simple but good looking, and work great for compact layouts (in particular, the number controls and mini-sliders are nice for parameter-dense panels like this). One interesting thing - components can be smoothly scaled within a panel, which is great for resolution independence, or if you want slightly bigger buttons during your performance, etc. Also, SC is in dire need of some collapsing views like this.

Ableton Live
------------

As was mentioned in the thread, the flat colorful vector look is hip, but will probably not age well. Nonetheless, Ableton managed to use a lot of color (which is great for differentiation between elements in a realtime setting) without it looking garish or unprofessional.

Max/MSP
-------

Max/MSP has a high-contrast, literal style very particular to this environment. It looks precise and very readable, however too specific. It is well suited for mixing text and GUI.
