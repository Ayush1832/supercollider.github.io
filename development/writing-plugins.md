The helpfile <a href="http://doc.sccode.org/Guides/WritingUGens.html">Writing Unit Generators</a> (from SC’s help system) covers what you need in order to create a UGen plugin (including Xcode instructions for those on Mac). Plugins are dynamically loaded libraries (DLLs) written in C++.

You can also read the chapter <a href="http://supercolliderbook.net/danstowellch25.pdf">“Writing Unit Generator Plug-ins”</a> from the official SuperCollider Book.
