<p>For those in the area, Wed. 11/11 (this Weds.) at <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/itp/">ITP, NYU</a> 721 Broadway 4th floor (rm442, the conference room), around 6:30, there will be a meeting of SuperCollider users.</p>
<p>and guaranteed, no one is going to say RTFM to you (or me, if they know what&#8217;s good for them)&#8230;</p>
