					<p>Saturday, 31.03.2012, 11.00 - 19.00 (with break) @ LEAP<br />
<br />
A one day workshop by Fredrik Olofsson about generating strange graphics in the audio programming language SuperCollider. The idea is to not care much about how the code we write actually sounds or works, but rather that it looks cool graphically. We will deliberately perform odd math operations to mess up the audio signals and explore and abuse the scope, plot and post windows as well as draw custom waveforms and spectrograms.<br />
<br />
The level of the workshop will not be too advanced and there is no need to be a fluent SuperCollider programmer to make interesting visuals. Bring your own headphones and a laptop with SuperCollider (3.4 or 3.5, <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/</a>) installed. If you have trouble installing this software please come half an hour early and we will help. Workshop language is english.<br />
