<p>We would like to announce that we are hosting the next SuperCollider<br />
Symposium in Berlin, September 23-26, 2010.<br />
Berlin is a very attractive city for artists and has great diverse and<br />
lively music scenes. We have found some great locations for concerts,<br />
workshops and conference talks, and we are currently finalizing the rest of<br />
the locations and will provide more detailed information on our website<br />
shortly.</p>
<p>The symposium will introduce SuperCollider (SC) to new users, show the<br />
current state of development, and host talks and presentations of a variety<br />
of artistic and/or scientific projects realised with SC.<br />
The 4-day conference will be preceeded by 5 days of workshops intended as<br />
community service to help beginning programmers, composers and artists with<br />
specific SuperCollider techniques<br />
All Concerts, performances and exhibitions will be open to the public.<br />
