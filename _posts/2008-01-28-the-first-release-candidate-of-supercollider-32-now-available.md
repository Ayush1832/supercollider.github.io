Thanks to the efforts of lots of SC developers, we can now announce that the first 'release candidate' of SuperCollider 3.2 is now available.

Mac bundle and source-code downloads are available at:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=54622

The 'release candidate' means that the developers consider it appropriate for general release, so we're putting it out for general use and testing. If no important problems are revealed then this will be the official 3.2 release, the release on which the forthcoming book will be based.

The changelog, showing what's new, can be seen here: http://tinyurl.com/28nx7b
