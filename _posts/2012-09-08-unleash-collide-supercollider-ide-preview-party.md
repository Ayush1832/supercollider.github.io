<p>As a conclusion of SuperCollider residency where Tim Blechmann and Jakob Leben are developing a new IDE (integrated development environment) for SuperCollider - a powerful language for sound synthesis, Cyberpipe is throwing a preview party. The SC-IDE is hoped to make SuperCollider finally a cross-platform “app” (on Linux, Mac &amp; Windows). The “party” will include a lot of (possibly live) music, informal demo and - most imporantly - free code in abundance!</p>
