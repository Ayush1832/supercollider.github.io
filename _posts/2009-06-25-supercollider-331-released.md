We are happy to announce the release of SuperCollider 3.3.1, the environment and programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition.

The most important update in 3.3.1 is compatibility with Safari 4, so Mac users can now happily update. There are also some GUI improvements, plus other helpful tweaks ([full changelog](http://supercollider.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/supercollider/trunk/build/ChangeLog?revision=9256&view=markup)).
