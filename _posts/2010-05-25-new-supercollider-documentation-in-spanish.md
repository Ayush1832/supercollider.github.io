<p>We are glad to announce that we are releasing the Spanish translation of  a group of SuperCollider help files and tutorials; the files are  available at &lt;<a href="http://tallerdeaudio.googlepages.com/" target="_blank">tallerdeaudio.googlepages.com</a>&gt;. This work  was possible thanks to a grant given by the Art Education, Research and  Diffusion Grant Program in Mexico City (PADID, for its acronym in  Spanish). The translations were made by Ernesto Romero, Rodrigo Frenk,  Juan Sebastian Lach and Sergio Luque.</p>
<div id=":55" class="ii gt"><p>Feel free to make any corrections and please send them to us, so we can  add the changes to the repository. We are also looking forward to  receiving new help file translations from anyone who wants to  participate in this open project.</p>
<p>Direct link to the help files:<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/tallerdeaudio/AyudaSC3Esp.zip" target="_blank"> http://sites.google.com/site/tallerdeaudio/AyudaSC3Esp.zip</a></p>
<p>Best wishes,<br />
The SuperCollider Spanish Translation Team</p></div>
