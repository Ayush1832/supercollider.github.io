March 8th 2PM: Switch-from-Max!  ... (and other patch cable based systems)

A one-day workshop focusing on the free software SuperCollider and why programming with syntax can be both easier and far superior to the graphical ditto (aka. patching). It is unfortunate that code or syntax often scares artists and musicians at first sight. We will try to cure this fear by showing fairly simple examples of how SuperCollider can be used to produce music and sound much more dynamically than using the static and deceitfully easy patching paradigm.  More particularly we will do granular synthesis, randomly generated synthesis networks and networked music - all the things that are a real pain to do in systems like Max/MSP.

Intermediate level - knowledge of basic computer music concepts like filters and envelopes is required, knowledge of some patching system (Max/PD) is a plus.

>What to bring:

1. Laptop running Linux, OS X or Windows
2. SuperCollider 3 installed (version 3.2 recommended): http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/
3. Headphones
4. 10 Euros participation fee

>About the Teacher:

Fredrik Olofsson, aka. redFrik, is a musician and developer who also sometimes performs tricks with visuals and electronics.
