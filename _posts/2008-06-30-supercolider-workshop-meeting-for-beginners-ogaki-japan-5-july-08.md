SuperCollider workshop for beginners will be held on Sat. 5th July by Fredrik Olofsson.

SuperCollider is an audio programming language which is known for its beautiful sound and special functions to produce algorithmic musical events.
It will be a practical and hands-on workshop focusing on quickly getting familiar with the SuperCollider environment and how to code small but very noisy programs.

Also examples of sc works will be shown  by sc users.

And after the workshop we're planning to have dinner together with Fredrik.
