Get ready to get sucked into the supercollider vortex !!

SuperCollider has established itself as probably the most powerful
programming environment for real time sound synthesis,
algorithmic/generative music and all sorts of other audio-related
ap...plications. It is widely used by artists and scientists alike for
both research and actual artistic creation. It features a powerful
state-of-the-art sound engine and an easy to learn fully featured object
oriented language. More, it is open-source and totally free of charge.

This three day intensive workshop welcomes participants of any discipline
with or without prior programming or musical experience and guides them to
their first sounds, instruments and musical structures with supercollider.
Apart from a thorough introduction to the Supercollider language and the
synthesis server, the workshop aims to be an informal introduction to
algorithmic/generative music, GUI design, live coding and digital sound
synthesis with SuperCollider.

Wednesday 11th January 2012 - Friday 13th January 2012
