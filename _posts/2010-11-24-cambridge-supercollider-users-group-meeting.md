<p><strong>Cambridge SuperCollider Users Group - Meeting #1 Tues 14th December, 7.30pm @ The Punter </strong></p>
<p>following STEIM's lead[1] I am starting a users group in Cambridge, UK for people interested in meeting and discussing SuperCollider stuff. I'm sure that there must be some people on this list that would be interested in getting involved. The first meeting will be informal, i.e. in a pub and I'm looking to meet once a month - every second Tues.</p>
<p>I'm therefore proposing that we meet from 7.30pm in The Punter[2] on Tuesday the 14th of December for our first meeting. Of course, nothing should be set in stone - so if you have any enthusiastic points to make about this proposal and want to get involved then please join the Google Group here: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sc-cambridge">http://groups.google.com/group/sc-cambridge</a>.</p>
<p>Looking forward to meeting people in a couple of weeks,</p>
<p>Sam</p>
