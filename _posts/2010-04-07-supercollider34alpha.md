<p>We&#8217;ve been working on a new release of SuperCollider, and the first <strong>preview</strong> version is now available.</p>

<p>3.4 includes many many improvements over 3.3.1, including great work on full 64-bit support for mac and linux - detailed changelog here: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/sc34ach">http://tinyurl.com/sc34ach</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an <strong>&#8220;alpha&#8221; release</strong> meaning there may still be some tweaks that we need to fix before the final 3.4 release, so we&#8217;d be grateful for feedback.</p>
