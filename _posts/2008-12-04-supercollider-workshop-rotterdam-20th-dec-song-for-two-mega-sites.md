<p><span><span><strong>Song For Two Mega-Sites: A free SuperCollider Workshop</strong></span></span></p>

<p>We'll build a device that will represent changing network connectivity as audio. Several of the core concepts important to the free audio language SuperCollider will be explained as the device is being put together. You can <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/2120822" target="_blank">see the result here</a>.</p>

Requirements for participation:

1. A laptop with wifi capability and headphone output
2. Headphones
3. [Download SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/). Follow the instructions contained in the download to install it
4. Check that your install works correctly by running [the 'hello world' examples here](http://tinyurl.com/5aknfu)

No previous experience with audio programming is necessary, but some familiarity with scripting or programming in general will help you get the most out of the project. Ideally you should be familiar with the following terms: variable, function, array, class and instance.

I run SuperCollider on OS X. If you use Linux or windows it should be possible for you to follow the project, but it's advisable that you work through some platform-specific tutorials beforehand to ensure you have a good understanding of the basics of navigating SuperCollider on your OS.

<p>The workshop will take place as part of a group of interesting live acts, installations and workshops on Saturday 20th December at <a href="http://www.defabriek.nu/" target="_blank">De Fabriek</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Hendrik+de+Keyserstraat+60%2C+Rotterdam%2C+Netherlands" target="_blank">Rotterdam</a>. NB. The exact time of the workshop is not yet known and will be published nearer the 20th.</p>

<p>There are 15 places available. If you'd like to participate, please email your name to info@defabriek.nu with &quot;Registration for SuperCollider workshop&quot; as your subject line.</p>
