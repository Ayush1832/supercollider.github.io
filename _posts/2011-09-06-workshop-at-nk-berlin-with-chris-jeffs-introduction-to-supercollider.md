<h3><strong>Introduction to SuperCollider – from the very beginning.</strong></h3>
<div class="entry">
<p>SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. But what does that mean?</p>
<p>“Programming” is the act of giving a computer instructions to follow. Using SuperCollider involves typing commands into a text window and getting some sounds in return. So why would anybody want to do that?</p>
<p>- for musicians: to have greater control over synthesis and create sounds not possible through other means.<br />
- for sound engineers or scientists: to have a better understanding of the nature of sound and digital audio.<br />
- for composers: to explore the world of algorithmic composition, an area in which SuperCollider excels.</p>
<p>-for the curious: to investigate something new and different, and make some cool sounds.</p>
<p>This course assumes no prior knowledge whatsoever in the fields of computer science or sound synthesis. Starting from “what is a synthesizer,” and with an emphasis on practical action, we progress quickly to making and controlling sound patches, taking in digital audio synthesis and computing topics as they arise.</p>
<p>To prepare for participation in this introductory course, download and install a free version of SuperCollider at the link below:<br />
<a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/">http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/downloads/</a><br />
Versions are available for Mac, Linux and Windows. Please make sure that you have a running version installed before you come to the course.<br />
For all installation questions and problems send an email to info@nkprojekt.de prior to the course.</p>
<p>Instructor: This course will be taught by Chris Jeffs an advanced SuperCollider user who has been working with this software since the last ten years.<br />
