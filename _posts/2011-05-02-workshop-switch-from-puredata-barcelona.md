<p>Workshop: Switch from PureData! (or MAX/MSP for that matter)</p>
<p>Led by Fredrik Olofsson [ <a href="http://fredrikolofsson.com/" target="_blank">http://fredrikolofsson.com</a> ]</p>
<p>During this one-day workshop we will focus on the free software<br />
SuperCollider and show why programming with syntax can be both easier<br />
and superior to patching in graphical environments.  This session will<br />
offer chance for beginners as well as seasoned users of other synthesis<br />
environments to get a taste of the features that make SuperCollider such<br />
a flexible and powerful tool. While not intended as a full introduction<br />
to this synthesis environment, it will function as a preparatory session<br />
for a series of SuperCollider seminars that we are preparing for after<br />
the summer.</p>
<p>Topics will include envelopes, patterns, granular synthesis and<br />
networked music. These are specifically chosen to show how SuperCollider<br />
is a very dynamic system where things easily are replaced on the fly or<br />
adapted to varying number of sound channels, the kind of things that are<br />
cumbersome or hard to do in PureData.</p>
