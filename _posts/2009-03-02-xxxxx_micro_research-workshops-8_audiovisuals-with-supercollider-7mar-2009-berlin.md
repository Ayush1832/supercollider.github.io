**March 7th 2PM 2009: Audiovisuals with SuperCollider (with Fredrik Olofsson)**

syn-er-gy : noun : the interaction or cooperation of two or more organizations, substances, or other agents to produce a combined effect greater than the sum of their separate effects.

(OED)

A one-day workshop in which we explore synergies in the form of very
direct and one-to-one relationships or mappings between sound and image.
The claim is that your music will turn out completely different as you
cross map with visual elements. And vice versa: your graphics will
look different as you code them to sound better. Audiovisual mapping
is a treasure chest of inspiration for control, generation,
organisation and systemisation of sounds. We will be using the free
software SuperCollider and, as a springboard, the article "Audiovisuals with SC" (http://www.fredrikolofsson.com/f0blog/?q=node/316). You will learn how to make up your own synergies.

Intermediate level - some familiarity with SuperCollider required. You
should at the least know how to run and modify code examples.

What to bring:

1) Laptop running Linux, OS X or Windows

2) SuperCollider 3 installed (version 3.2 or later): http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

3) Headphones

4) 10 Euros participation fee (including food)

About the Teacher:

Fredrik Olofsson, aka. redFrik, is a musician and developer who also
sometimes performs tricks with visuals and electronics.
