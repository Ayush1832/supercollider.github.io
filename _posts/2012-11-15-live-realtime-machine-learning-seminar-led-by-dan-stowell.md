title: "Live Realtime Machine Learning (seminar led by Dan Stowell)"

This seminar will explore machine listening and machine learning in SuperCollider, applied in real time to perform intelligent signal processing on live audio streams. We will specifically focus on server-based processing of sound streams (i.e. not on “offline” machine learning or general compositional aspects). We will study classification, clustering and regression using built-in analysis tools (plus standard sc3-plugins and quarks), covering important machine-learning techniques such as Self-Organising Maps, K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbours, Sparse Representations and more.

Level: intermediate (some basic knowledge of SuperCollider and sound synthesis is assumed)

Instructor: Dan Stowell

Dan Stowell (MCLD) is a musician, programmer, and scientist. In 2010 he obtained a PhD in Machine Learning and Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, where he is now currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in the Centre for Digital Music. Dan has been developing techniques to use voice sounds such as beatboxing to control electronic instruments. In his musical practice, he combines live-coding with beatboxing – both solo and as part of the duo Spoonfight – and also produces installation work as part of C4DM Presents. He’s currently also one of the lead SuperCollider developers.
