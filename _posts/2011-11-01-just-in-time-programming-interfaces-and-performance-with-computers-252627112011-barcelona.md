<p>This seminar will explore the possibilities of SuperCollider to create realtime systems for computer music. We will work following the methodology of just-in-time programming, which allows the modification of parts of an algorithm while it is executing. Likewise, we will see how to integrate our instruments with a wide variety of control devices in a flexible and reliable manner. After each session, we will evaluate the behaviour of our programs under live performance conditions.</p>
