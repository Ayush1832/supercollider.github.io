<p><strong>Sonic Seminars 2011</strong></p>
<p>This autumn’s seminar series will be dedicated to computer music performance and composition. Four leading practitioners will guide participants from the fundamental concepts of audio synthesis and computer programming to more advanced topics, including sound analysis, just-in-time programming, communication with hardware devices and stochastic composition.</p>
<p>The course has the additional goal of functioning as a progressive introduction to SuperCollider, a free cross-platform environment for sound synthesis, analysis and composition that is used by musicians, artists and scientists alike for a wide range of purposes: from composing generative music to developing electronic instruments, building interactive installations or sonifying scientific data.</p>
