<p>i&#8217;m happy to report that my SuperCollider-created program  &#8220;particularity&#8221; has won<strong> joint 1st prize in the LoMus 2010 competition</strong>:<br />

it seems like a good time to say thanks to the developers for all their  work, and for the user crew here in berlin and elsewhere for their  continued inspiration.</p>
<p>also thanks to alberto for the influence of pulsar generator, as my  program started life as an attempt to replicate in some way its  perceived functions.</p>
<p>aside from my feelings of personal glory, this is the second time in a  row that a supercollider created project has won first prize (last time  was ixiquarks)<br />
so i think that&#8217;s quite good as well!</p>
