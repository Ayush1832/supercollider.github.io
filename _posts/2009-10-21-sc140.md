<p>Twitter messages are limited to 140 characters, barely enough for a sentence - so it's nothing short of miraculous that SuperCollider users have been creating <em>entire musical compositions</em> that fit within that limit.</p>
<p><a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/sc140/">The album "sc140" is now out</a> featuring the best of these pieces! It's free to listen and download and even comes with the 140-character source codes so you can generate or tweak the sounds yourself. <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/sc140/">Download it now</a></p>
