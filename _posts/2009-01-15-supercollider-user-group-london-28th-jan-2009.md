The [Centre for Digital Music](http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/digitalmusic/) (at [Queen Mary University of London](http://www.qmul.ac.uk/)) will host a SuperCollider user-group meeting on **Wed Jan 28th**. It will start at **2pm**, in **room 105** of the Electrical Engineering building, QMUL, London **E1 4NS**.

No specific agenda as yet, but we'll probably look at some of the new features in 3.3, and hear about some people's projects.

I'm co-ordinating the event using Facebook:

Those attending from outside the college will need to be let into the building, so please make yourself known via the Facebook page or to dan.stowell atatat elec.qmul.ac.uk and we'll make sure we let you in!
