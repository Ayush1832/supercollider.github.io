<p>The <a href="http://www.elec.qmul.ac.uk/digitalmusic/">Centre for Digital Music</a> (at <a href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/">Queen Mary University of London</a>) will host a SuperCollider user-group meeting on <strong>Wed Jan 28th</strong>. It will start at <strong>2pm</strong>, in <strong>room 105</strong> of the Electrical Engineering building, QMUL, London <strong>E1 4NS</strong>.</p>

<p>No specific agenda as yet, but we'll probably look at some of the new features in 3.3, and hear about some people's projects.</p>

<p>I'm co-ordinating the event using Facebook:<br />

Those attending from outside the college will need to be let into the building, so please make yourself known via the Facebook page or to dan.stowell at@at@at elec.qmul.ac.uk and we'll make sure we let you in!
