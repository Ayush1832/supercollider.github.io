<p>An installation using SuperCollider and Arduino in Belfast next week, by Robyn Farah (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9auK5YO3sA">previous</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXKVYWvsJCs">works</a>):</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> 8th September 14:00 – 18:00<br />
<strong>Where:</strong> Surround Room in the Sonic Arts Research Centre, Queen&#8217;s University, Malone Road (opposite the Botanic Inn), Belfast</p>
<p>An environment to excite the imagination.</p>
<p>An installation using sound and light, where the sound is algorithmically<br />
triggering different sound patterns. As this installation is set in a dark<br />
room, the participant is unaware of the size of the room, and what it’s<br />
contents are, leaving a lot to the participant’s imagination. Hence the<br />
participant begins creating his/her own environment , within the<br />
installation space, around the given sounds and lights.</p>
