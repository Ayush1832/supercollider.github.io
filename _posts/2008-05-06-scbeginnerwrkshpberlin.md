<p>Description of course topics:</p>

<p>SuperCollider for Beginners</p>

<p>SuperCollider is an environment and programming language for real time audio synthesis and algorithmic composition. It has a large and growing library of sound synthesis modules and supports structural concepts in composition as well as new approaches to musical design like live coding.<br />
The architecture of SuperCollider is optimized for working in real time and for networking with other softwares and machines via Open Sound Control.</p>

<p>SC3 is free and open source, runs under OSX, Linux and Windows.<br />
Binaries as well as sources of SC3 can be downloaded from http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/</p>

<p>The participants must bring their own computers with SC installed.<br />
The main platform for the course will be OSX.<br />
In general, Linux or Windows will work as well but you have to install SC by yourself in advance!<br />
In order to run SC under Linux you need to configure emacs as an editor and to install SwingOSC as GUI for SC.<br />
For Windows you need Psycollider and SwingOSC as GUI.</p>

<p>Topics<br />
- basic concepts of SC3:<br />
server (scsynth) and client (sclang),<br />
synths and synthdefs (patches)<br />
nodes and busses<br />
- modules for synthesis und processing of audio signals:<br />
unit generators (oscillators, noise, filters, delays ...),<br />
buffers and sampling<br />
envelopes, triggers, control signals<br />
FFT<br />
- language basics:<br />
objects and messages, classes and methods<br />
functions, arguments and variables<br />
operators<br />
collections (arrays, lists, dictionaries ...) and list processing<br />
control structures (if, while, do, switch ...)<br />
- generation and organisation of events and sounds:<br />
scheduler and tasks<br />
streams and patterns<br />
scores<br />
recording und non-real-time recording<br />
- synthesis and audio processing examples:<br />
additive synthesis<br />
granular synthesis<br />
delay-based effects<br />
multichannel and spatialization techniques<br />
analysis and intermodulation techniques<br />
presentation of projects and realizations<br />
- control and networking:<br />
Open Sound Control and remote servers<br />
MIDI and HI devices<br />
- other topics:<br />
GUI overview<br />
live coding<br />
extensions</p>
