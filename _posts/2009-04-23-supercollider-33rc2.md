<p>The SuperCollider developers have been working hard since the <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/2009/supercollider-symposium-2009-the-evidence/">symposium</a> on finishing the new release of SuperCollider. A release candidate is now available, uploaded on SourceForge - if all looks well with this version, it will be released as the official version 3.3 next week.</p>

Mac UB and source-code bundles are uploaded here:
