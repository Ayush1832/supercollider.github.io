<p>There are many changes since 3.3.1 (<a title="changelog for supercollider 3.4" href="http://supercollider.svn.sf.net/viewvc/supercollider/tags/Version-3.4/common/build/ChangeLog">full ChangeLog</a>), including 64-bit support on mac and linux, iPhone support, performance improvements, and improved user interface features. Also, following the 3.4 “alpha” a couple of months ago we fixed a backwards-compatibility issue, made consistency improvements in JITlib, and more.</p>
<p>The &#8216;-with-extras&#8217; versions include the new version of SwingOSC too (0.65).</p>
<p>Many people contributed towards this release - not just the large group of developers but also people improving documentation, reporting bugs, and so on. Thanks to you all!</p>
<p><em>(Note for Windows users: The latest SC for Windows is 3.3.1. We don’t have many active Windows developers at the moment, so there won’t be a 3.4 version until that changes.)</em></p>
