A workshop on distributed stochastic composition and synthesis

Sergio Luque, Julian Rohrhuber

When

Thu 28 Feb 2008,
14:30 - 17:30

Location

Klanglabor, Filzengraben 8-10 (No. 3 on the KHM map)

Description

New ways to bring back the noise into the telephone line. Instead of separating signal and noise, we will try to devise new and beautiful uncertainties, reconstruct respected old noise sources and play with the intractable. This workshop will be an experimental laboratory for finding and exchanging stochastic algorithms that run on each otherâ€™s computers in the local network. We will give a brief introduction to the programming language SuperCollider, and continue into networked live coding of noise music. Please bring a laptop.
