<p><span>First Amsterdam SuperCollider Users Group Meeting</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Calling all SuperCollider users! </strong> </span><br />
Ever wonder if there was a more elegant approach to a piece of code you wrote? Or looking for a new UGen to give you that unique sound you&#8217;re searching for? Maybe you just want to get some constructive criticism on a piece you&#8217;ve been working on. Coming up on 22 November STEIM is very excited to be hosting the first meeting of the Amsterdam SuperCollider Users Group, organized by local SuperCollider expert Marije Baalman and users like yourself.</p>
<p><strong><em>Date: Monday, November 22, 2010<br />
Time: 19:00 hrs.<br />
Venue: Steim Studio 3, Utrechtsedwarsstraat 134, Amsterdam<br />
Entry: Free<br />
</em></strong><br />
The SuperCollider user meeting aims to bring together SuperCollider users in the Netherlands. This monthly meeting is a place to get to know other SuperCollider users of all levels of expertise, and to share and discuss this powerful audio programming language. Come present your work, either finished projects or works in progress, share the tools you have created and get feedback from other users on your work. If you have questions on how to do certain things or want to learn how to do specific things within SuperCollider, we can look into these topics together. This first meeting we&#8217;ll start out with a meet and greet of all the participants, and have presentations from some of the participants who&#8217;d like to talk about what they&#8217;ve been working on.</p>
<p>STEIM will provide a studio space and PA-system for your music-making pleasure. Drinks will also be available.<br />
happy coding<br />
