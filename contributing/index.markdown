## Bugs and Features

For bug-reports and feature requests see: [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues)

But asking on the mailing list first is always a good idea.


## Pull requests

Gratefully accepted at [github/supercollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider)

Please don't put un-related commits in a single pull request.  Separate by functionality or issue.  Try not to change spacing or needlessly rearrange things if they don't have anything to do with the issue you are fixing.  Save rearrangement for a separate commit.
